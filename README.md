# Macro-Post-Processing
In my current role as an Engineer in an automation fabrication pipeshop, I frequently work with PCFs provided by various projects and clients. However, these files often are not compatible with the automation software used to generate Isometric drawings, leading to errors. Given the challenges of requesting each project or client to modify their file formats, I developed an alternative solution that would automate the process.

To address this issue, I developed a Python script that automatically processes and modifies PCF files to ensure they are compatible with our automation software. This script can handle multiple PCF files at once, removing irrelevant sections and making necessary attribute adjustments to meet the software's requirements. By streamlining this process, I have significantly reduced manual intervention, saving time and improving workflow efficiency.

This solution is designed to be used by Engineers or teams who need to quickly modify large numbers of PCF files to align with specific software compatibility standards.
